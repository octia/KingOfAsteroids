# KingOfAsteroids
A space-shooter test project, aiming to create a high-preformance simulation of a large amount of asteroids (over 25k) on mobile at 60fps.
It uses compute shaders for collision detection.
This was created in a week, along two other projects, in Unity. This is not a finished product, but it is playable.
